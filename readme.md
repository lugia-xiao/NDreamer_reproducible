# Reproducible of the NDreamer paper

A discription of files in the following directory:

### benchmark

The codes for benchmarking previous methods on the single cell experimental perturbation datasets.



### case_control

The codes for applying NDreamer to the case control datasets



### case_control_benchmark

The codes for benchmarking previous methods on single cell case-control comparison datasets.



### plots

The codes for plotting figures in the benchmarking part in the case-control datasets



### R_plot_codes

The R code for plotting the benchmarking figures and the GO enrichment analysis on the SEA-AD dataset.



### reproducible

The code for applying NDreamer to single cell experimental perturbation datasets.



### Other notes

Files end with .ipynb but not the .nbconvert is the original codes, and files with .ipynb and .nbconvert is the files with results that come from files end with .ipynb but not the .nbconvert.

Please note that, for some file, the result .ipynb files are too large to upload to github, for these file, I simply upload the version with all results removed.

But for most results, the file is small enough to upload.
